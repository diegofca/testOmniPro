# Test app Photos Api

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

Use flutter version:  >= 3.22.1

Flutter Bloc was used as a dependency manager,
clean Architecture, and singleton pattern for the injection of dependencies with GetIt, Http was used as a manager of Asynchronous calls to an API, and CacheImageNetwork was used to load remote images.

In order to run the app you just have to launch the "flutter pub get", -> install pod if it is for iOS, and to finish flutter run.
